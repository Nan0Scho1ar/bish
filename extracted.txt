About Us

BioToolKit Foundation is an Australian nonprofit organization dedicated to creating an intuitive, streamlined, open source bioinformatics environment. Our organization works closely with developers, engineers and scientists worldwide to bridge gaps between existing tools in computational biology through standardized interfaces. We develop tools to unify processes across a variety of operating systems and integrate those developed by third parties into our environment as they emerge.

Scope of Work

The mission of this project is to develop a single, unified environment which is OS agnostic and simplifies setup and use of a system which is tailored to a bioinformatics work load. It will have a key focus on portability, allowing users to easily share system configurations to facilitate reproducible results. This will be an ongoing project, but the initial step is focused on the development of a bioinformatics shell loader which can run on top of any POSIX-compliant shell of your choosing. This will implement existing standards and specify new ones where none exists. This bioinformatics shell (BiSh) will seamlessly integrate with common bioinformatics tools. We estimate that BiSh will be established in late December 2021.


Objectives & Timeline

    Building BiSh (Christopher Mackinga)
        Build self-replicating shell loader. February 2021
        Integrating with existing system tools.  July 2021
        Provide interface for third party tools to integrate with BiSh. August 2021
        Set up hosting to allow users to run or install BiSh with a single command. August 2021
    Integrate BiSh with common bioinformatics tools (Anna Toussaint, Christopher Mackinga)
        Curate initial list of tools to be integrated. Continual, starting February 2021
        Ensure syntax and functionality is consistent across a variety of hardware and operating systems. Continual, starting February 2021
        Seamlessly integrate tools with BiSh. Continual, starting August 2021
        Provide bridges between tools using existing interfaces where possible. Continuous, starting September 2021
    Documentation of BiSh use (Anna Toussaint, Christopher Mackinga)
            Write man pages explaining use. Continuous, starting March 2021
            Write a series of example use cases.  Continuous, starting March 2021
