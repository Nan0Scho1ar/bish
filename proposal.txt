About Us

BioToolKit Foundation is an Australian nonprofit organization dedicated to creating an intuitive, streamlined, open source bioinformatics environment. Our organization works closely with developers, engineers and scientists worldwide to bridge gaps between existing tools in computational biology through standardized interfaces. We develop tools to unify processes across a variety of operating systems and integrate those developed by third parties into our environment as they emerge.

Scope of Work

The mission of this project is to develop a single, unified environment which is OS agnostic and simplifies setup and use of a system which is tailored to a bioinformatics work load. It will have a key focus on portability, allowing users to easily share system configurations to facilitate reproducible results. This will be an ongoing project, but the initial step is focused on the development of a bioinformatics shell loader which can run on top of any POSIX-compliant shell of your choosing. This will implement existing standards and specify new ones where none exists. This bioinformatics shell (BiSh) will seamlessly integrate with common bioinformatics tools. We estimate that BiSh will be established in late December 2021.
